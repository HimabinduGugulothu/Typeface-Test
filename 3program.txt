q:Design a datastore to save monitoring data of a service. Assume the service has 100 APIs and there are 1000 users who are roughly making 1 million requests per day. Some of the sample queries that will be performed on this datastore

- Get the API with maximum average response time across the users.
- Get the API with maximum average response time for each user.
- Get error percentage of each API in buckets of 1 hours for 24 hours.


solution:

APIs that are considered high-performing have an average response time between 0.1 and one second.

--> Get the API with maximum average response time across the users.

step 1: Method of calculating metrics gathered by each API response time test tool.
Step 2: Tools Simulate the load and capture speed which can make a difference in the response time.
Step 3: Extra items recorded when monitoring user loads.
step 4: Computing metrics gathered by each tool increases the response time due to high resource consumption.
Step 5: The architecture of the two tools may be different.
The API with maximum average response time across the users is 0.01

--> The API with maximum average response time for each user is  1 second .

-->Get error percentage of each API in buckets of 1 hours for 24 hours is 120 requests within 60 seconds.
